        Hello, I'm <mark class="orange">Richard</mark>,
        a software engineer living in the Bay Area.
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently a student at UC Berkeley studying computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm a production engineer intern at
        <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>.
        Previously, I've worked as a software engineer intern at
        <a href="https://8thwall.com">8th Wall</a>
        doing full stack work. I've also done full stack work as a contract
        software engineer at other smaller startups.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in distributed computing, digital accessibility, and simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>
