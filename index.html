        Hello, I'm <mark class="orange">Richard</mark>,
        a software engineer living in the Bay Area.
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently a student at UC Berkeley studying computer science and a
        production engineer intern at <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I've worked as a contract software engineer intern at <a
          href="https://8thwall.com">8th Wall</a>, as well as a contract software
        engineer at other smaller startups working as a full stack engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in distributed computing, digital accessibility, and simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>Have a nice day.</p>
