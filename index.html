      <h1>
        Hello, I'm <mark class="orange">Richard</mark>,
        a software engineer living in the Bay Area.
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently a production engineer at
        <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I graduated from
        <a href="https://berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a>
        in 2020 with a B.A. in Computer
        Science. Previously, I've also worked as a software engineer intern at
        <a href="https://8thwall.com">8th Wall</a>
        doing full stack work. I've also done full stack work as a contract
        software engineer at other startups. In my free time I like to tinker
        with my
        <a href="https://aeoly.us/s/homelab">homelab</a>
        and build mechanical
        <a href="https://aeoly.us/s/mk">keyboards</a>
        !
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in distributed computing, digital accessibility, and simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>
